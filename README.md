A  repo (landing-page) demonstrating the skills learned in TOP's Foundations course.

# Intro
This project is a culmination of skills and lessons learned from TOP's Foundation course so far. The skills learned include -but are not limited to- the following:

* Working in the terminal
* The use of elements, tags and selectors
* Using links and images
* Styling using external CSS
* Using margins and padding
* Understanding Specifity, Inheritance and rule order
* Flexbox and fles stylings

#Result
Once complete I did notice that I was able to use the skills learned, however it was not perfect.
I was still missing a lot in terms of perfecting the use of flexbox, padding and margins.
The layout felt off and the page sizing leaves much to be desired.
The html looks clungky with so many divs and classes.
CSS could have looked better if I had used grouping and chaining better.
Best way to go about fixing the problem is creating more projects using the same layout and researching more until I feel comfortable.
